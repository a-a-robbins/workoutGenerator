# workoutGenerator
base, workout generator in C

the long term hope for this program is to take user input from a series of
questions, then output to a .txt file a suitable workout based on the user's 
desires. 

as of 2/2021 it will provide a basic workout, however it does not do
so with all the desired feedback and intricacy I would like.

more documentation: 

This program is a rough draft of what I hope will become a solid workout generator, that can not only take the guess work out of designing an exercise routine, but also will provide helpful advice. 

The main things to know about this program is it does have specified input/output files, but you don't really need to worry about that. The program will deal with pulling them in itself and all the user need do is follow the prompts on the screen. The program will determine the appropriate file to pull from and generate a completed workout plan to the output.txt file. 

The files that must be included when running are: 
    cardio.txt
    fullbody.txt
    output.txt
    struct.c
    struct.h 
**Note: you do not need to input these into the command line, they only need to be available for the program to access

For this project, I would like to be graded on: 

1. String Manipulation
2. File I/O 
3. Pass by Pointer
4. Structures
5. Recursion
6. Header Files 

Thank you for taking the time to check out my program...I hope that even though it is in a very base form, you still found it unique and enteratining :)
